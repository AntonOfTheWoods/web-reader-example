# web-reader-example

This repository has a "cleaned" version of the [upstream example](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/web-reader/tree/0.3.3/example) that doesn't require the proprietary `AxisNow` code and uses npm references to the upstream `@nypl/web-reader` rather than relative imports. This makes it much more realistic in terms of understanding the developer experience for projects using `web-reader` in this way.
